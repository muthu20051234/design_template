      <li><strong>Device & App Data:</strong> device model, OS version, app version, language, approximate IP-derived location, crash logs.</li>
      <li><strong>Location Data (with your permission):</strong> precise or approximate location for features like showing nearby services, maps/navigation, or provider tracking.</li>
      <li><strong>Payments:</strong> payment status, order IDs and non‑sensitive metadata from payment partners (we do <em>not</em> store full card/UPI credentials).</li>

      <li>Automatically from your device when you use the app.</li>
      <li>From third‑party sign‑in, messaging, maps, analytics, and payment providers you interact with.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To operate and improve the app, display listings, process bookings, and show relevant results near you.</li>
      <li>To authenticate you (Google Sign‑In / OTP), prevent fraud, and keep our services secure.</li>
      <li>To send service notifications, OTPs, and important updates (e.g., booking status, payment confirmation).</li>
      <li>To provide customer support and respond to your requests.</li>
      <li>To comply with law and enforce our Terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Legal Bases (where applicable)</h2>
    <p>We process your information based on your consent, our legitimate interests in providing and improving the service, and to perform a contract with you (e.g., processing a booking or payment), and/or compliance with legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>5) Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We may share information with:</p>
